[13:55:54] === GOAL ===
Your goal is to successfully run the APOSMM optimization script 'run_example.py' 
and ensure it finds enough local minima.

WORKFLOW:
1. Run the script
2. If SUCCESS: Report and stop
3. If FAILED (errors): Read the script, fix errors, run again
4. If OPTIMIZATION_NEEDED (not enough minima):
   a. Use read_optimization_results to analyze the data
   b. Use get_aposmm_options to see what you can adjust
   c. Use add_h0_to_script to add previous results to the next run
   d. Use modify_bounds to change lb/ub if needed (based on your analysis)
   e. Run again
5. If STOPPED: You've used all attempts. Report final status and stop.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Maximum 3 optimization attempts total
- ALWAYS analyze results BEFORE making changes
- Base decisions on data, not random guessing
- For H0: ALWAYS use the add_h0_to_script tool - never write H0 code yourself
- Do NOT loosen tolerances (that's cheating)

Start by running 'run_example.py'.

NEXT STEPS:
1. Use read_optimization_results to analyze the data
2. Use get_aposmm_options to see available tuning options
3. Decide what changes might help (bounds, optimizer, H0, etc.)
4. Modify the script and run again

IMPORTANT: Base your changes on ANALYSIS of results, not random guessing.

[13:56:10] === TOOLMESSAGE ===

=== APOSMM Configuration Options ===


APOSMM Generator Options (gen_specs["user"] parameters):

REQUIRED:
- lb: array[number] - Lower bounds of the search domain
- ub: array[number] - Upper bounds of the search domain  
- localopt_method: string - Local optimizer name (see below)
- initial_sample_size: integer - Points to evaluate before local optimization

OPTIONAL (you can adjust these):
- max_active_runs: integer (default 1) - Max simultaneous local optimization runs
- sample_points: array[array[number]] - User-specified initial sample points
- dist_to_bound_multiple: number - Fraction for initial localopt step size
- mu: number - Minimum distance from boundaries for localopt starts
- nu: number - Minimum distance from existing minima for localopt starts
- rk_const: number - Multiplier for r_k value when launching new runs

LOCAL OPTIMIZERS (derivative-free, for scalar f):
- scipy_Nelder-Mead: Nelder-Mead via SciPy (robust, good default)
- scipy_COBYLA: Constrained optimization via SciPy
- LN_BOBYQA: NLopt bound-constrained quadratic model (good for smooth problems)
- LN_SBPLX: NLopt subplex method (good for noisy objectives)
- LN_NELDERMEAD: NLopt Nelder-Mead (robust but slower)
- LN_COBYLA: NLopt constrained optimization

TOLERANCE OPTIONS (DO NOT LOOSEN - this is cheating):
- For SciPy: xatol, fatol (absolute tolerances)
- For NLopt: xtol_abs, ftol_abs, xtol_rel, ftol_rel


=== TUNING STRATEGIES ===

Analyze the optimization results and consider what changes might help:

1. **BOUNDS (lb, ub)**: If best points cluster in a region, consider focusing there.
   
2. **OPTIMIZER (localopt_method)**: Different optimizers suit different problems.
   Options: scipy_Nelder-Mead, LN_BOBYQA, LD_MMA, etc.

3. **SPACING (nu)**: Controls how far apart local opt starting points must be.

4. **USE H0**: Pass previous results to the next run to build on prior work.

NOTE: max_active_runs should not exceed (num_workers - 1).

=== USING H0 WITH APOSMM (Class-based API) ===

To reuse points from a previous run, you must add TWO things:

STEP 1: Add this code block AFTER gen_specs is defined but BEFORE the Ensemble is created:

    # Load previous results - use the .npy filename from read_optimization_results
    H0 = np.load("run_example_history_length=302_evals=300_workers=4.npy")
    
    # Recompute x_on_cube for the new bounds
    lb = gen_specs.user["lb"]
    ub = gen_specs.user["ub"]
    H0["x_on_cube"] = (H0["x"] - lb) / (ub - lb)

STEP 2: Add H0=H0 to the Ensemble constructor:

    ensemble = Ensemble(
        libE_specs=libE_specs,
        gen_specs=gen_specs,
        sim_specs=sim_specs,
        alloc_specs=alloc_specs,
        exit_criteria=exit_criteria,
        executor=exctr,
        H0=H0,  # <-- Must add this
    )

COMMON MISTAKE: Adding H0=H0 without the np.load() code above. 
You MUST do BOTH steps or you'll get "Initial points in H have never been given"

=== FORBIDDEN (CHEATING) ===

DO NOT loosen tolerances (xatol, fatol, xtol_abs, ftol_abs).
DO NOT randomly try different optimizers without reason.

=== COMMON MISTAKES ===

1. Adding H0=H0 to Ensemble without the np.load() line - causes "Initial points never given" error
2. Forgetting to recompute x_on_cube when bounds change
3. Writing incomplete scripts (summaries instead of full code)
