============================================================
AGENT GOAL:
Your goal is to successfully run the APOSMM optimization script 'run_example.py'
and ensure it finds enough local minima.

WORKFLOW:
1. Run the script
2. If SUCCESS: Report and stop
3. If FAILED (errors): Read the script, fix errors, run again
4. If OPTIMIZATION_NEEDED (not enough minima):
   a. Use read_optimization_results to analyze the data
   b. Use get_aposmm_options to see what you can adjust
   c. Use add_h0_to_script to add previous results to the next run
   d. Use modify_bounds to change lb/ub if needed (based on your analysis)
   e. Run again
5. If STOPPED: You've used all attempts. Report final status and stop.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Maximum 3 optimization attempts total
- ALWAYS analyze results BEFORE making changes
- Base decisions on data, not random guessing
- For H0: ALWAYS use the add_h0_to_script tool - never write H0 code yourself
- Do NOT loosen tolerances (that's cheating)

Start by running 'run_example.py'.

- **Local minima x values:**
  - [-0.08987747, 0.71267664]
  - [-0.08982067, 0.71269954]
  - [-0.08985863, 0.71264705]

### Final Status:
- **Result:** SUCCESS
- **Action:** No further steps needed.
