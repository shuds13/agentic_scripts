============================================================
AGENT GOAL:
Your goal is to successfully run the APOSMM optimization script 'run_example.py'
and ensure it finds enough local minima.

WORKFLOW:
1. Run the script
2. If SUCCESS: Report and stop
3. If FAILED (errors): Read the script, fix errors, run again
4. If OPTIMIZATION_NEEDED (not enough minima):
   a. FIRST: Use read_optimization_results to analyze where good points are
   b. Look at the SUGGESTED BOUNDS in the output
   c. Modify the script to narrow lb/ub to focus on the promising region
   d. Optionally add H0 to reuse previous points (see get_aposmm_options)
   e. Run again
5. If STOPPED: You've used all attempts. Report final status and stop.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Maximum 3 optimization attempts total
- ALWAYS analyze results BEFORE making changes (don't guess randomly)
- The MOST EFFECTIVE change is narrowing bounds based on where best points are
- Do NOT loosen tolerances (cheating)
- Do NOT randomly try different optimizers

Start by running 'run_example.py'.
