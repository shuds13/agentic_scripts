============================================================
AGENT GOAL:
Your goal is to successfully run the APOSMM optimization script 'run_example.py'
and ensure it finds enough local minima.

WORKFLOW:
1. Run the script
2. If SUCCESS: Report and stop
3. If FAILED (errors): Read the script, fix errors, run again
4. If OPTIMIZATION_NEEDED (not enough minima):
   a. Use read_optimization_results to analyze the data
   b. Use get_aposmm_options to see what you can adjust
   c. Use add_h0_to_script to add previous results to the next run
   d. Use modify_bounds to change lb/ub if needed (based on your analysis)
   e. Run again
5. If STOPPED: You've used all attempts. Report final status and stop.

CRITICAL RULES:
- Maximum 3 optimization attempts total
- ALWAYS analyze results BEFORE making changes
- Base decisions on data, not random guessing
- For H0: ALWAYS use the add_h0_to_script tool - never write H0 code yourself
- Do NOT loosen tolerances (that's cheating)

Start by running 'run_example.py'.

AGENT COMPLETED
============================================================

Final response:
The APOSMM optimization script 'run_example.py' has successfully run and found enough local minima!

### Summary of Results:
- **Number of local minima found:** 3
- **Local minima x values:**
  - [-0.0899544, 0.71270546]
  - [1.70371242, -0.7960727]
  - [1.70368194, -0.79595192]

This concludes the optimization process successfully. If you need any further assistance or analysis, feel free to ask!
